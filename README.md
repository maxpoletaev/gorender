# GOXGL

A purely software (no OpenGL or DirectX) 3D rasterizer written, that Iâ€™m trying 
to build to learn more about 3D graphics programming. It uses raylib for window 
management and input handling, but all the rendering is done from scratch.

## Building

For this, you may need a C compiler (gcc or clang) and additional dependencies 
required by raylib. See https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go#requirements
for more details.

```
$ make build
```

## Running

```
$ ./goxgl models/suzanne.obj
```

## Features

 * [x] Wireframe rendering
 * [x] OBJ file loading
 * [x] Backface culling
 * [x] Transformations
 * [ ] Texture mapping
 * [ ] Shading
 * [ ] Z-buffering
 * [ ] View frustum clipping
